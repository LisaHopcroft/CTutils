First, a caveat: This is still in development, I'm expecting bugs.
Please report!

## What is CTutils?
 

CTutils is an R package containing methods to assist in writing
statistical study reports for clinical trials, although the functions
could well be useful in other contexts. I wrote these functions
primarily for myself but thought I may as well release them publicly
and learn a thing or two about collaborative coding, Github, package
deployment etc etc....

## Is there a vignette?

There are a couple:

* `CTutils-Quickstart.Rmd` tells you how to get started
* `CTutils-Functions.pdf` gives you a bit more information about
specific CTutils functions


## How to install

``` r
# library(remotes)
# remotes::install_github("LisaHopcroft/CTutils")
library(CTutils)
```
