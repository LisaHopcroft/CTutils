### TASK: add the Country and the Age groups that will inform   ###
###       the EudraCT report at the end of the trial.           ###
###################################################################

### Example: Adding country for EudraCT extract; this example is
###          for the situations where all patients are known to be
###          in the same country. If the trial ran in different
###          contries, it may be that a case_when() statement is 
###          required to annotate each patient as being from the
###          correct country.
###          
# data_updated = data_updated %>%
#   mutate( Country = "United Kingdom" )

### Example: Adding Age groups for EudraCT extract; this utility
###          function is included in the CTutils package.
###          
# data_updated$EudraCT_agegroup = factor( convert_dates_to_EudraCT_age_categories(
#   dob = data_updated$Enrolment_Elig_Checklist_DOB,
#   dor = data_updated$Enrolment_Trial_Enrolment_Date_Enrol
# ), levels = c( "Newborns (0-27 days)",
#                "Infants and toddlers (28 days-23 months)",
#                "Children (2-11 years)",
#                "Adolescents (12-17 years)",
#                "Adults (18-64 years)",
#                "From 65-84 years",
#                "85 years and over"
#   ) )
