Description: This package was developed to support the statistical work done at SCTRU
    (Scottish Clinical Trials Research Unit) as part of Public Health Scotland, from
    outline planning applications to data dissemination and close-down. It is intended
    to record, document and test data analysis methodologies in accordance with SAPs;
    document the calculation of sample size calculations; help generation of consistent
    statistical study reports; plan appropriately for drug distribution
    (consumption/delivery/supply); generate reports for trial monitoring activites (e.g.,
    DCR reports); facilitate data dissemination (e.g. EUdraCT XML upload, redacted datasets);
    prepare appropriate materials and documentation in anticipation of MHRA inspection;
    among lots of useful things that I haven't thought of yet.  The hope is that providing
    these utility functions will streamline analysis development time and increase
    resilience in the statistics function of SCTRU.
