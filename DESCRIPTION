Description: This package was developed to support the statistical work done at SCTRU
    (Scottish Clinical Trials Research Unit) as part of Public Health Scotland, from
    outline planning applications to data dissemination and close-down. It is intended
    to help perform simple tabulations, plots and listings and encourage the consistency
    in the generation of statistical study reports.  There are plans to facilitate data
    dissemination (e.g. EUdraCT XML upload, redacted datasets) and
    prepare appropriate materials and documentation in anticipation of MHRA inspection;
    among lots of useful things that I haven't thought of yet.  The hope is that providing
    these utility functions will streamline analysis development time and increase
    resilience in the analyst function of SCTRU.
